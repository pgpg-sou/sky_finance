      | Sky Finance provides funding from many different financial providers. We don’t have any strict criteria. We do have guidelines that are flexible. In the end it comes down to the borrower’s profile and how much you want to borrow. Your profile is made up of many things such as: job stability, asset backing, credit history and bank account conduct to name just a few. Affordability is really the only thing that is non negotiable. If an applicant can’t afford to service the loan then they are very unlikely to get approved.

  | You can apply to borrow within your ability to afford the loan. That’s not to say that the financial providers will automatically approve your application as they may take other factors into consideration such as security and credit history.

li.a
  | Normally we can get an application approved within hours. In order to do this we need an application form completed, a clear copy of photo ID (Passport and/or Drivers License), confirmation of income (Payslip), two months latest bank statements (Bank Account Conduct) and information about the vehicle being purchased (CIN card, the Consumer Information Notice or VOSA, the Vehicle Offer and Sales Agreement). These can be emailed or faxed to us.

li.a
  | Typically it is a car, caravan, boat, property or other assets/chattels. The amount that can be lent to you is not solely dependent on the value of the security, but your affordability and your credit profile.

li.a
  | In most cases we can still get an application approved. Our lenders aren’t worried about minor defaults on your credit record. In many cases we need to provide an explanation as to why larger defaults occurred. If the default is unpaid then sometimes this can be an issue. Ex-bankrupt applications are also not major problems for us as we get these types of applications approved regularly.

li.a
  | We do accept beneficiaries and also take Family Assistance, ACC, child support payments and student loans into account. You do still need to meet the affordability guidelines and we need to follow Resposible Lending Code as a Responsible Lender.
